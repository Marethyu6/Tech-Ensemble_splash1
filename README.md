# Tech-Ensemble_splash1
A simple gif-like splash screen for KDE-plasma + related wallpaper.  
Made with the FLOSS software "Krita" by me (Marethyu6 on github or Matteo B. for general attribution).  
Tested for Debian 10 and 11 with a 1366x768 screen.  

# Applying
To apply this as splash screen (half-CLI half-GUI pseudocode):  
1. just clone the repository  
`git clone https://github.com/Marethyu6/Tech-Ensemble_splash1`  

2. then copy the whole directory into your /home/YOUR-USER-NAME-HERE/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/ directory  
`copy -a Tech-Ensemble_splash1 /home/YOUR-USER-NAME-HERE/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/`  

3. this will make it appear within the choices in the splash screen selection options of the System Settings application for KDE-plasma: select it and apply  

For the wallpaper just set it as wallpaper by clicking on the file wherever you've downloaded it or by selecting it from the dedicated section in System Settings.  

Your done!


# Extra info
This is just a way for me to backup this little tweaking attempt to create my first custom splash screen, so any improvement suggestion is welcome, as even I've noticed some stuff could work better (e.g. gif without proper timing...).  
For the colours palette I was inspired by some anime characters, file names are clues, if you want to guess please open an issue!
